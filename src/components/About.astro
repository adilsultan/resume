        <p>
          I'm a Strategic Software Engineer with a background in Cloud Observability and Technical Consulting.
          I specialize in translating complex customer requirements into production-ready architecture, with a
          proven track record of building high-frequency data pipelines and AI-driven SaaS platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work lives at the intersection of enterprise SaaS and bespoke engineering — navigating the gap
          between "out-of-the-box" platform limitations and the custom solutions that businesses actually need.
          Whether it's designing microservices, orchestrating multi-cloud infrastructure, or building agentic
          AI workflows, I focus on delivering systems that are both scalable and deeply tailored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my day-to-day, I'm building independent ventures in algorithmic trading and AI observability,
          driven by a fascination with real-time data systems and autonomous intelligence. Based in San Jose, CA.
